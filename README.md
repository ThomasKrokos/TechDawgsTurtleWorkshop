Text from the take home flyer: How to Download Python at Home

Make sure you're using a system that can download programs and apps (so probably not your school laptop). Make sure you have your parents permission before downloading anything onto your device. Look up "Python" on your preferred web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and click on Welcome to Python.org.

Look for the Download tab near the top of the website and select the Operating System of your device. Under Stable Releases, select the first Download option (it may be called an Installer). Once the installer downloads, click on it and click through the steps it walks you through. Don't be alarmed if it asks you to agree to something. Once it is done installing, make sure that you have IDLE and move IDLE to somewhere you can easily access it.

Open up IDLE and select File, New File near the top of the screen/window. Within this file you can write whatever python code you want, including turtle graphics. Make sure you save the file somewhere you can access and make sure it uses the .py extension. To run, simply open IDLE and type the name of your .py file into command line.

So, you got stuck downloading Python. Don't panic. Here are some tips.
1. You can always just try to start the whole process over if something went wrong
2. Ask your parents for assistance when downloading. You can also ask your computer teacher at school.
3. Make sure that your computer has enough memory to handle the download. This information should pop up during the download process.
4. If worse comes to worse and it doesn't seem to work, visit CodeHS online, select Online IDE, Python, and scroll down and select Python Turtle. This provides an online space for you to code and test code. We cannot garuntee that everything we provide will work in CodeHS.
